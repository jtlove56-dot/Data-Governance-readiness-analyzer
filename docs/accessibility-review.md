# Usability and accessibility review (v1.0)

Covers SCRUM-17. Target: WCAG 2.1 AA, and completion by a non-specialist in under five minutes without separate instructions.

Reviewed build: the assessment flow on `SCRUM-17-accessibility`, which includes the SCRUM-15 PDF report. Reviewed on 26 September 2026.

## How this was checked

| Method | What it covers | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `axe-core` on every step of the flow | Machine-checkable WCAG 2.1 A/AA failures: names, roles, labels, landmarks, heading order | `frontend/tests/accessibility.test.tsx`, run by `npm test` |
| Contrast maths against the stylesheet | 1.4.3 text contrast, 1.4.11 control boundaries | This document, "Contrast" below |
| Keyboard walkthrough in a browser | 2.1.1 keyboard, 2.4.3 focus order, 2.4.7 visible focus | Manual, desktop and 375&nbsp;px |
| Responsive check at 375×812 | 1.4.10 reflow | Manual |
| Plain-language review | Comprehension, jargon | This document, "Language" |
| Structured scenario walkthrough | Completion without instructions, timing | This document, "Completion time" |

`axe-core` cannot judge contrast in jsdom, so the `color-contrast` rule is disabled in the test and contrast is verified against the stylesheet instead.

## Findings and fixes

| # | Severity | Finding | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | High | Step numbers in the progress list were `#777d73` on `#151714` — 4.26:1, below the 4.5:1 needed for 10&nbsp;px text | Changed to `#9aa096` (6.73:1) |
| 2 | High | The textarea placeholder was `#898e86` on `#fbfaf5` — 3.20:1 | Changed to `var(--muted)` (5.48:1) |
| 3 | High | Choice and Yes/No buttons were outlined in `--line` `#cdcfc4` — 1.51:1 against the surface, below the 3:1 that WCAG 1.4.11 requires for control boundaries | Added `--control-line: #8e9386` (3.01:1) for interactive controls, leaving `--line` for decorative rules |
| 4 | Medium | No way to skip the masthead; keyboard and screen-reader users walked the header on every step | Added a "Skip to the assessment" link, visible on focus, targeting `#assessment` |
| 5 | Medium | The whole workspace was `aria-live="polite"`, so screen readers re-announced the entire panel on every change | Replaced with a visually hidden `role="status"` that announces "Step N of 4: <name>" and the assessing state; focus still moves to the step heading |
| 6 | Medium | The step heading had `outline: none` on focus, so keyboard users got no indicator when focus moved there | Suppressed only for `:focus:not(:focus-visible)`, with a visible ring for `:focus-visible` |
| 7 | Low | At phone width the character counter collided with the help text under the textarea | `.field-meta` stacks below 560&nbsp;px |
| 8 | Low | The Karlsgate panel listed capability names only ("Protected matching · De-identification"), with no explanation | Each capability now shows its approved plain-language description from the rubric |

All eight are fixed on this branch. No high-severity issues remain open for the demo.

## Contrast

Every text and control colour in `app/globals.css`, measured against its own background:

| Element | Ratio | Required | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Step name | 5.87:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Step number (fixed) | 6.73:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Completed step | 11.17:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Eyebrow label | 9.54:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Sidebar intro | 11.78:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Progress copy | 6.73:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Body and help text | 5.48:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Placeholder (fixed) | 5.48:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Error text | 7.61:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Section number | 7.58:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Score, high risk | 7.61:1 | 3:1 (large) | Pass |
| Score, low risk | 7.55:1 | 3:1 (large) | Pass |
| Capability panel text | 11.78:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |
| Control borders (fixed) | 3.01:1 | 3:1 | Pass |
| Footer | 15.92:1 | 4.5:1 | Pass |

## Keyboard and screen-reader behaviour

- Every control is reachable and operable with Tab, Enter and Space. There are no custom key handlers to learn, and no keyboard traps.
- Focus is visible everywhere: a 3&nbsp;px brass outline with a 3&nbsp;px offset.
- The first Tab reveals the skip link.
- Moving between steps puts focus on the new step heading, which scrolls it into view.
- Selected options carry `aria-pressed`, and the current step carries `aria-current="step"`.
- Steps not yet reached are `disabled`, so they are skipped in the tab order rather than being focusable dead ends.
- Errors use `role="alert"`; the status region announces step changes and "Assessing your answers."
- Smooth scrolling and panel animation are disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Not conveyed by colour alone

The risk level is stated in words ("HIGH RISK", "The proposed use case is high risk"), and colour only reinforces it. Selected choices show a tick mark as well as a filled background. Score factors list their points numerically.

## Language

- Every question that used privacy jargon now carries a plain-language note: what "another organization" means, what counts as data leaving its environment, why combining datasets matters, and what reuse means. "Raw identifiable values" was already explained.
- Capability names are accompanied by the approved rubric copy, so "De-identification" and "Protected matching" are explained rather than assumed.
- The disclaimer says the report is decision support and not legal advice, in both the app and the PDF.
- Wording not changed: the capability copy and risk guidance are approved text from `docs/risk-scoring-rubric-v1.0.md` (SCRUM-6). Any rewording needs product-owner approval.

## Completion time

A structured walkthrough of the full flow — read the questions, answer them, read the result, download the report — takes **about two and a half to three minutes** for someone familiar with the material, well inside the five-minute target. The questionnaire is seven questions on a single step, which is the bulk of the time.

**This is a proxy, not user evidence.** The acceptance criterion asks for representative non-specialist users. `docs/usability-test-script.md` is the script for those sessions, with a table for times and observations. Once it is filled in, add the median here.

## Known limitations

- No testing with assistive technology yet: findings come from `axe-core`, the stylesheet and keyboard walkthroughs, not from a VoiceOver or NVDA session with a screen-reader user.
- Automated checks cover roughly a third of WCAG criteria. The rest were reviewed by hand.
- No testing at 200% or 400% browser zoom.
- The button order on the recommendations step reverses at phone width (Start over, Download, Back). It is operable and logical top to bottom, but worth a look if the team revisits that screen.
- Completion-time evidence is a walkthrough by the developer, not real users.
