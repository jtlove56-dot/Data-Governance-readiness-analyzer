# Risk-to-safeguard mapping v1.1

Story: SCRUM-12. Epic: SCRUM-19. Requirements: FR-5 and FR-6.

Status: **stakeholder approved**.

## Approval Record

On October 7, 2026, the project contributor confirmed in the project conversation
that the stakeholder had approved SCRUM 12. This record reflects that confirmation;
no stakeholder name or separate signed approval document was supplied.

Approval covers the SCRUM 12 safeguard associations, capability wording, and
documented applicability conditions. This is not a legal compliance certification
or an approval of unrelated scoring thresholds. Existing legal/privacy limitations
and specialist-review notices remain unchanged.

## Release Changes

- Catalog `backend/app/scoring/mappings/v1.1.json` sets `version` to `1.1` and
  `approvalStatus` to `approved`.
- Safeguard text, associations, and capability conditions are unchanged from v1.0.
- API results, the on-screen assessment record, and PDF exports carry the new
  mapping version and approval status.
- Catalog v1.0 remains immutable and can still be replayed explicitly with its
  original pending status. Scoring rules and the request schema remain unchanged
  by this approval release.
- The frontend catalog is generated with
  `python scripts/sync-recommendation-mappings.py` and checked by CI.

The original [mapping specification](recommendation-mapping-v1.0.md) documents
the factor coverage, conditions, and result contract. Its pending status is
historical; this release supersedes it for current assessments.

## Integration

Submit SCRUM 12 to `dev`, not `main`. The branch was implemented against the earlier
v1 assessment contract. Newer team changes on `dev` introduce a v2 contract and
prioritized recommendations. Resolve and validate that overlap during PR review
before merging; do not replace the team's newer validation and request handling
with the older implementation.
